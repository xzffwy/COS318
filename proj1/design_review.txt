HOW TO MOVE KERNEL FROM DISK TO MEMORY

Where to find kernel on disk?
	Kernel is located right after bootloader (slide 5)

Where to copy in memory?
	0x1000 (slide 5)

How to do the copying assembly?
	using int $0x13. createimage informs the number of sectors to read. we read starting at track 0, and head 0. begin reading at sector that contains end of bootblock. drive should be already set. set bx to 0x1000
	
	note that we cannot cross 64k segments in one 0x13 interrupt (in case we load from floppy drive).  need some code along the lines of:
		if (read_start MOD 64k) != (read_end MOD 64k):
			read_end = read_start MOD 64k + 64k

Under what circumstances must bootloader be relocated?
      if the kernel is more than 128 sectors in size you must move the bootloader.

HOW TO CREATE THE DISK IMAGE

Given an ELF, show how to use the header info to find where the first code segment begins:
	(assuming at least one program i.e. e_phnum > 0)
	1st program occurs at (Program Header Start Offset + Num headers * Program Header Size): e_phoff + e_phentsize

Show how to determine where in the image file this segment must be placed:
	see "Base Address" section of ELF documentation

Where to write padding:
	force padding by writing p_memsz > p_filesz
	do this for convenient locations, force contiguous segments, etc
