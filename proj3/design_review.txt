condition:wait -- comes in with lock. lock until desired condition is true (put something on block queue)
condition:signal -- lets something come off blocked queue

semaphore: need to track if things are up or down.  these also get blocking queue

timer interrupt:
	turn off interrupts
	increment timer
	call check-sleeping (wakes up tasks that are past deadline)
	save state of current task
	put on back of ready queue
	load in new task
	re-enable interrupts
	
cause process to sleep
	change status to blocked. put on sleep queue. enter scheduler
	
cause process to wake up
	???take off sleep queue (based on deadline). change status enqueue to ready queue???
	
if all sleeping:
	call idle thread (exists already in scheduler.c).  this spins, waiting for something to enter the ready queue.  causes timer to be incremented (which works with deadlines)
